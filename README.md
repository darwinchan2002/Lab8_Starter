1. We should run our automated tests whenever we do a github action, to prevent code with error doesn't get merged into our build/main branch/build.
2. No
3. No, since we use unit test to test small parts of code. We should use something similar to the previous part (E2E testing) to test out the "message" feature. However, it is good to use unit test to test small parts of our code to make sure they are functioning properly.
4. Yes! I would consider this as a pretty small part of our whole application. Using unit test to test the functionality of it would be a reasonable way of doing so.
