1. We should manually run the automated tests in our project before pushing the code to Github.
2. No
3. No, since we use unit test to test small parts of code. We should use something similar to the previous part (E2E testing) to test out the "message" feature. However, it is good to use unit test to test small parts of our code to make sure they are functioning.
4. Yes! I would consider this as a pretty small part of our whole application. Using unit test to test the functionality of it would be a reasonable way of doing so.
